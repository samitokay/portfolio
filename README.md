Portfolio README
Overview
This project is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work, skills, and contact information. The website consists of several pages including an about page, projects page, and contact page.

Process
Development Process
Planning: I started by outlining the structure and content of each page in my portfolio. I determined the sections I wanted to include and sketched out a basic wireframe to visualize the layout.

Design: Once I had a clear idea of the structure, I focused on the design aspect. I chose a clean and modern design using Bootstrap framework as the base and customized it with CSS to reflect my personal style.

Implementation: I began implementing each page, starting with the home page and then moving on to the about, projects, and contact pages. I paid attention to responsiveness and accessibility, ensuring that the website looks good and functions well across various devices and screen sizes.

Testing and Refinement: Throughout the development process, I continuously tested the website to identify and fix any issues or bugs. I also gathered feedback from friends and colleagues to improve usability and user experience.

Challenges Faced
Responsive Design: One of the main challenges I faced was making the website fully responsive. It required careful consideration of layout and styling to ensure that the content remains readable and visually appealing on different devices.

Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility with various web browsers was another challenge. I encountered some issues with certain CSS properties rendering differently in different browsers, which required troubleshooting and adjustments.

Overcoming Challenges
Research and Documentation: I relied on online resources, documentation, and community forums to research solutions to the challenges I encountered. I also documented my findings and solutions to reference later.

Iterative Approach: I adopted an iterative approach to development, tackling one challenge at a time and making incremental improvements. This helped me stay focused and motivated, and eventually overcome the challenges I faced.

Lessons Learned
Importance of Planning: Planning and outlining the project beforehand proved to be crucial in maintaining a clear direction and avoiding unnecessary roadblocks during development.

Continuous Learning: Building my portfolio website provided me with an opportunity to learn new techniques and technologies. I gained valuable experience in web development, design principles, and best practices.

Persistence and Problem-Solving: Facing challenges during development taught me the importance of persistence and problem-solving skills. By staying determined and resourceful, I was able to overcome obstacles and achieve my goals.
